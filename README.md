# Advanced Persistent Bot (APBot)
Advanced Persistent Bot, or APBot, is an AI chatbot that provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.

APBot is a chatbot created using deep learning. It provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Currently, most of the information I have used is from FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html).
To run the bot, use "python main.py"

Before running the bot, make sure that you have all the requirements. Check the file "Requirements" for the full list.  
If you have any issues, let me know.
