# APBot
Advanced Persistent Bot, or APBot, is an AI chatbot that provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.

APBot is a chatbot created using deep learning. It provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Currently, most of the information on APTs I used are from FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html). Future updates will include detailed information from multiple sources.

To run the bot, use "python main.py"
