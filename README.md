# Advanced Persistent Bot (APBot)
Advanced Persistent Bot, or APBot, is an AI chatbot that provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.

APBot is a chatbot created using deep learning. It provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Currently, most of the information on APTs I have used are from FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html). Future updates will include detailed information from multiple sources, in particular CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, and MITRE.  
I also want to provide more details, such as TTPs, operations, and nomenclature.
Ideally, APBot will be able to provide all the information found on "APT Groups and Operations" (https://apt.threattracking.com)

To run the bot, use "python main.py"

# Requirements
Before running the bot, make sure that you have all the requirements. Check the file "Requirements" for the full list.  
If you have any issues, let me know and I will try my best to assist you.
